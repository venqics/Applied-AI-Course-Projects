# Applied-AI-Course - Case Studies

In 2019, I enrolled in Applied AI Course and dropped out at that time after reading some Machine Learning Research Papers which consisted of scary math formulas. But later completed the course and eight Case Studies on my own.

I still remember this wonderful course by Srikant Varma breaking down each Machine Learning Concept on Black board with a Marker like 3Blue1brown style videos.
